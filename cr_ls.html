Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the

<br>
For example:<br>
<ol type="a">
	<li>A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly 
	taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as 
	A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.</li>
	<li>Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a 
	warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells 
	it. Here, the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be 
	taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may 
	have committed criminal breach of trust.</li>
</ol><b><br>
Theft by Clerk or Servant of Property in Possession of Master (Section 381)</b><br>

<br>
<b>Punishment for Extortion (Section 384)</b><br>

the theft, the offender, that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to 
person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of 
instant hurt, or of instant Wronged restraint.<br>
<br>

clothes, without Z consent. Here, A has committed theft, and, in order to the 
committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has 
therefore committed robbery.<br>

<b>When Extortion is Robbery</b><br>
Extortion is 'robbery' if, offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is

restraint to the person or to some other person, and, by so putting in fear 
induces the person, so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing

Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here, A has extorted the purse from Z 
by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the

legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of 
such trust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits 'criminal

person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to 'cheat'.<br>

deceives Z, and thus dishonestly induces Z to let him have on credit goods for 
which he does not mean to pay. A cheats.<br>
<br>
A, by putting a counterfeit mark on an article, intentionally deceives Z into a
